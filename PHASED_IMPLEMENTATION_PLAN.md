# Nav Hunter Online - Phased Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased approach to rebuild Nav Hunter Online on Vercel, starting from a minimal working dashboard and progressively adding features.

## Current Status (as of Phase 1 completion)
- âœ… Basic dashboard with SSE connection
- âœ… Real-time alert display
- âœ… Start/Stop monitoring controls
- âœ… Connection status indicator
- ðŸ”„ Testing connection stability on Vercel

## Phase 1: Foundation & Real-time Display âœ…
**Goal**: Establish a working foundation with real-time data flow

### Completed:
1. **Real-time SEC filing display**
   - SSE connection to `/api/alerts/stream`
   - Alert cards showing company, ticker, form type, confidence
   - Visual distinction between Gold/Blue alerts
   - Auto-reconnection on disconnect

2. **Basic monitoring controls**
   - Start/Stop buttons
   - Connection status (green=connected, red=disconnected)
   - Processing and alert counters
   - API routes: `/api/sec/start` and `/api/sec/stop`

3. **Clean architecture**
   - Client-side state management
   - No complex dependencies
   - Successful build and deployment

   - [ ] Processing delay indicator

2. **Status Panel Component**
   - [ ] Real-time connection indicator with color states
   - [ ] Filing and alert counters
   - [ ] Uptime timer
   - [ ] Flash animation when receiving data

3. **Monitoring Controls Enhancement**
   - [x] Start/Stop controls (basic version done)
   - [ ] Add loading states
   - [ ] Error handling and user feedback
   - [ ] Disable controls during transitions

## Phase 3: AI Integration
**Goal**: Enable AI analysis and configuration

### TODO:
1. **AI Analysis Display**
   - [ ] Parse and display AI analysis results
   - [ ] Confidence score visualization
   - [ ] Key points and recommendations
   - [ ] Analysis modal for full details

2. **Configuration Panel**
   - [ ] Form type filters (8-K, 10-Q, etc.)
   - [ ] Confidence threshold slider
   - [ ] AI prompt template editor
   - [ ] Save configuration to localStorage

3. **Test Ticker Feature**
   - [ ] Single ticker input field
   - [ ] Test button to trigger analysis
   - [ ] Display test results
   - [ ] Clear test results

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Complete the full dashboard experience

### TODO:
1. **Audio Notifications**
   - [ ] Click-to-enable audio permission
   - [ ] TTS for gold alerts
   - [ ] Ping sound for blue alerts
   - [ ] Volume controls

2. **AI Terminal Sidebar**
   - [ ] Fixed 400px right sidebar
   - [ ] Real-time AI processing logs
   - [ ] Collapsible/expandable
   - [ ] Auto-scroll to latest

3. **Full Dashboard Layout**
   - [ ] Three-panel responsive design
   - [ ] Console log panel (bottom)
   - [ ] Dark financial theme polish
   - [ ] Mobile responsive adjustments

## Technical Guidelines

### Architecture Rules:
1. **Use SSE not WebSockets** - Vercel doesn't support persistent WebSocket connections
2. **Client-side state only** - Avoid server-side complexity
3. **Explicit Node.js runtime** - All API routes must have `runtime = 'nodejs'`
4. **No file system operations** - Incompatible with serverless
5. **Incremental deployment** - Test each feature before adding more

### Code Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React hooks for state management
- Error boundaries for stability
- Console logs for debugging

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Local development works
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Deploys to Vercel
- [ ] Features work in production
- [ ] No console errors

## Monitoring Backend Logs

### Development Mode:
1. **Browser Console**: Check for SSE events and errors
2. **Network Tab**: Monitor `/api/alerts/stream` connection
3. **API Route Logs**: Add console.log in API routes

### Production (Vercel):
1. **Vercel Dashboard**: 
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Functions" tab
   - View real-time logs

2. **Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   vercel logs --follow
   ```

### Add Debug Logging:
To see what the SEC API is receiving, add logging to `/app/api/sec/stream/route.ts`:
```typescript
console.log('[SEC Stream] Filing received:', {
  ticker: filing.ticker,
  formType: filing.formType,
  company: filing.companyName
});
```

## Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Not seeing SEC filings
**Possible Causes:**
1. SEC API key not configured in Vercel
2. WebSocket connection not established
3. Monitoring not started
4. No filings during off-hours

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Vercel environment variables
2. Look for connection logs in Vercel Functions
3. Click "Start Monitoring" button
4. Test with specific ticker using test feature (Phase 3)

### Issue: SSE connection drops
**Solution:** Auto-reconnect is implemented with 5-second delay

### Issue: No alerts showing
**Possible Causes:**
1. AI analysis not triggering
2. Confidence threshold too high
3. OpenAI API key missing

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check OpenAI API key in Vercel
2. Lower confidence threshold (Phase 3)
3. Check Vercel Function logs for errors
